# Brain Tumor Segmentation with YOLO 11 and SAM2

## Overview
This project focuses on brain tumor segmentation using advanced computer vision techniques. It leverages **YOLO 11** for real-time tumor detection and **SAM2 (Segment Anything Model 2)** for precise segmentation, ensuring accurate identification of affected areas in MRI scans.

## Features
- **YOLO 11** for detecting tumors in medical images efficiently.
- **SAM2** for precise segmentation of detected tumors.
- **Custom dataset** trained to improve accuracy.
- **End-to-end pipeline** for tumor detection and segmentation.

## Installation
To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install the required dependencies**
3. **Download the dataset and place it in the data/ folder**
